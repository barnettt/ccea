Sample integration project

An organisation asked me to show some evidence of JSF 2 Icefaces development. 
They gave me couple of days to doit. Unfortunately I did not complete the UI element in time. However all the necessary ground work
has been done to buld an Icefaces application with webflow and hibernate. I hope it may help somebody else who is trying to
work with these technologies. I have built Icefaces UI's on a number of occasions in my career. I have helped
Ice faces resolve a bug with their date component when Icefaces was version 1.8.2.

This application is a typical 3 tier MVC base application with webflow 2. It runs on a mysql database and glassfish application
server built with maven. The DB script is in the DB folder. feel free to try it out.
